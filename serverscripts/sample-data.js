	"I have never tasted tofu this fresh until I came here. It\'s just a completely new experience for your palette, and way better than anything store bought. The syrup is not as sweet, but I didn\'t mind it that much. I will come back here again for the soymilk next time. Also, come in early to buy tofu because I\'ve come here once in the middle of their store hours and they were already sold out. I then saw a woman carrying 12 boxes of tofu to her car and that's when I knew that something magical was happening inside",
	"Yum! I love the tofu pudding (dou hua) dessert here. It\'s about $2.50, and it tastes so fresh. There are some differences with traditional store bought tofu pudding though. - The tofu pudding is a lot softer than traditional pudding. It breaks a lot easier, so it can look not that appetizing, but it definitely still is. - The ginger syrup doesn\'t have ginger in it, and it is less sweet than what I\'m used to. Probably a good thing.Other good items are the soy milk and tofu.",
	"Cute mom and pop shop churning out possibly the best tofu I\'ve ever had! Super soft with the perfect amount of resistance. I put it in my miso soups and its the perfect complement. The tofu pudding is so silky and I love that they put the ginger syrup on the side so you may adjust to your liking.My one gripe is I never really know how much things are going to cost me. A tofu pudding with two half or quarter blocks of tofu were $5, but a tofu pudding with two large blocks of tofu were $7.25.Tips: Make sure to eat the tofu ASAP otherwise keep it in cold water and refrigerate. If you want small dices of tofu in stew, make sure to cut them smaller because they expand in soup",
	"How did I miss this place?! Fresh tofu? Heck ya! Who doesn't love fresh tofu?! I've had many sweet dessert tofu at various places growing up but this is the best place I've ever had of it. You get way more than you pay for! $2.75 would get you a huge tub of tofu + a small tub of sweet ginger syrup to douse on top of the tofu! Once you scoop the tofu out, you can taste the fresh-softness of the tofu but it still kept firm enough for you to indulge it with the sweet ginger syrup to add the sweetness to it.Located in Japantown in front of Jimbo's. This place is definitely old school which I really like about it. A great small locally owned family shop. Once you walk inside, there are no tables but you can see the huge pots and water running to make the fresh tofu. Basically a pick up and go place. Very sweet lady that works here! She was welcoming and friendly.Definitely a place to stop by! Fresh sweet dessert tofu perfect in any weather! Don't forget to bring cash!",
	"In A Nutshell: -As a born and bred San Jose resident, I love seeing mom & pop shops like this one still flourish! - Who doesn't like tofu?  Especially fresh, handmade tofu!  Buy it by the block. - They also sell some of the best flowers out there.  Why pay an arm and a leg for a bouquet of flowers when you can grab some here for less than $4.00 + they last 7-10 days.  They come directly from the farm. -The store is literally a hole-in-the wall, but I love that.  It's reminiscent of the little stores/bars/restaurants in Tokyo, small, but pack a lot.Overall, start eating healthier and buy fresh tofu from here.  It's worth it and cost-effective.",
	"Many years ago, I visited a Japanese grocery store in San Francisco that advertised \"San Jose Tofu\". And I thought, why the heck would San Francisco have to go to San Jose to get tofu? Isn't the tofu in San Francisco good enough?But then I saw the light and realized, no, there is nothing like San Jose Tofu. The atmosphere is exactly like you'd expect for a company called \"San Jose Tofu.\" It's a massive sink, a counter, and pantry. But the massive sink is where all the tofu production amazingness takes place. When you go in and place your order (walk-ins welcome, but be aware of their opening hours as they don't stay up late) they grab a block of tofu from the production sink and package it up for you. It doesn't get any fresher than this.The best part is, they don't gouge you here. The price has crept up slightly, but still in line with block packaged tofu from the store and waaaaaay better and tastier. I think it's currently $2.25 for a generous sized block and it just melts and crumbles in your mouth as tofu was meant to.They also have a very limited selection of vegetables and packaged items, all of which are the same as/slightly lower quality than and probably 2x as pricy as the grocery store down the street and 3-4x as pricy as the Farmer's Market. But that's not why we go here. Try the tofu and only the tofu, and you will not be disappointed.",
	"Came by because I was having cravings for a cup of tofu dessert with sugar syrup sauce. The dessert was yummy, silky and smooth.Just wish they took credit cards, I had to walk down the street to find an ATM.Overall the lady there was super nice and friendly.		I'll come back again:)",
	"There was white substance in my water. I ask for another glass of water. The waitresses gave my the \"just drink the water\" look",
	"My favorite drink here is the hochija milk tea with boba and egg pudding. It was my first time trying it and I love roasted green tea! The place is a little dirty though. They need to take out the trash more instead of letting it pile (kinda gross).",
	"I did not enjoy my time here at all. Mainly because of the long wait we had to go through. We got seated at around 10:30 pm. It was a little busy, but it wasn't super packed. It took maybe 30 minutes for a server to get us some drinks. His section didn't even look super busy! After we got our drinks, it took probably another 30 minutes, or more, for our server to take our orders. Before our order got taken, we were trying to get the attention from a different server so he could help us out, but he completely ignored us and only tended to his section. I found that completely rude. I am also a server at a different restaurant, and I always give my attention to any customer who calls out for me even if they aren't in my section.After we finished eating, our server, AGAIN, took forever for him to give us our check and a to-go box for our food. The manager had to come over and ask us what we needed so she could tell our server. When our server came over to drop off he check and box, he didn't even apologize for the long wait. In fact, he didn't say anything to us at all. He just dropped it off and that's it.The food was good. I just wish our service was better.",
	"I went during happy hour on a Sunday and I thought the price for a happy hour was definitely not much of a save",
	"Came here today for lunch, while the food is decent the service is terrible.  40 min for a sandwich and when I ordered there was no line. Basically, it seems like they are trying to cut costs, leading to a terrible dining experience.  The cashier taking your order is running around delivering food, pouring plates and bussing tables. The lack of service also effected my food, it was cold and the Yucatan fries didn't come out until 20 min later, by which time the sandwich was done. Having worked in the food business you can tell the cook and the front of the house are inexperienced at best. I hope they make changes because a good Cuban place is needed.",
	"(This review is for the buffet lunches) I work in 650 Castro and have seen many establishments come and go from this location. I REALLY hope this one stays.		As a vegetarian I've always been wary of vegetarian-only restaurants that push healthiness but skimp on flavor and creativity. Everything I've had from the Phoenix in 4 buffet visits (and counting) has been awesome. Thematically, I've seen 4 different world cuisines represented in those 4 visits (Thai, Indian, Italian, and today Carribean). The sides have also been increasing in variety. Matcha guacamole? Surprisingly works.Keep up the awesome work!",
	"Saw this spot the other day and had to check it out .Excellent prices, I gotta lil tongue here, I got some brains also. got some taco's, only 1.50 holy snap, I got 7 of them, then I got a burrito for an excellent price too.The prices are very reasonable, there's a great amount of meat , and the food is very fresh.I liked the sauces, very nice.		This is a great place.		Taco prices are rising, its hard to find taco's for this price these days.",
	"This is my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. I come here every year for my birthday and it is such a treat. When famous people come into town, it is safe to say they are choosing Evvia. The Oktopodoki is so simple yet to die for. The lamb chops are a classic. I recently got the mushroom skillet and that was decadent as well.As for dessert, the baklava and the galaktobrekko are must tries.The ambiance in here is very lively. Dim, but well decorated. Everyone is so friendly. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
	"Can't complain about this place. It's impossible to.The wait staff are very, very professional. Obviously ambience here is fantastic--the inside feels like someone's cozy home in a vineyard, blended with modern professional kitchen-ry and nice bottles of wine. The food is fantastic, although the portions were a little much for me. Of course, the food tasted delicious--even the complementary bread/olive-oil tasted very good.Overall, a good place to go when you want to impress someone.",
	"This is really a 4.5 star review, but the service was a little uneven when we were there, so I had to deduct half a star.  The server hardly ever came to check on us, even when we needed refills on our water and wanted to order dessert.As always though, the food was fantastic.  I came here with two of my friends for the first time in about 2 years, and the food was just as delicious as I remember it.  I ordered the lamb chops, which is an expensive entree for lunch at $30, but still remains my favorite lamb chops based on flavor and tenderness.  Some lamb I've eaten at other restaurants has a strong distinctively \"lamb\" flavor that I don't like, but the lamb at Evvia doesn't have that unpleasant taste and always tastes fantastic.  The presentation is also beautiful, and my only complain is I wish I could have a couple more potatoes.  I understand that having 3 potatoes makes the presentation really nice, but the potatoes are delicious with the lamb and I would have liked to have a couple more.Evvia lamb burger came with a house-made flatbread (I assume) that was really the star of the dish. They really put a lot of work and thought into the flatbread as it is a really developed mediterranean-esque flavor that is really quite spectacular and something I have never tasted in any other flatbread.Evvia has really excellent desserts.  The Evvia sundae might sound like simple ice cream sundae with ice cream, chocolate sauce, and nuts, but it is so much more than that.  Their whipped cream really tastes fresh, and their chocolate sauce is rich and unique without being too sweet.  I wish they used more vanilla beans in their whipped cream for a more pronounced vanilla flavor. The addition of vanilla beans would also add to aesthetic appeal with individual specks dispersed within the whipped cream. The ice cream is also delicious and the chocolate ice cream has such a deep intense chocolate flavor.  Of course, the toasted hazelnuts on top add both flavor and texture to the dessert.  The sundae is expensive at $12.50, but the portion is generous and the sundae is amazing.The second dessert we ordered was the galaktoboureko, which I've eaten every single time I've come to Evvia.  As everyone else has said, it is definitely a must order if you've never tried it before! It may be too sweet for some people but you still must try it!  The pistachio ice cream pairs perfectly with the warm phyllo dough and delicious vanilla bean semolina custard.",
	"Awesome restaurant!  We save this one for special occasions because it is a little pricey and definitely hard to get a reservation on a Saturday night.  The food is delish and we always drink at least one bottle of wine in a night.  If you like lamb, this is the place to have it!! Wish I had some pics to share... well, next time!!!",
	"Overpriced, but the food is quite good.Evvia has gotten a lot of hype, and my friends and I had tried two times prior to eat here, but without reservations we were always thwarted. Finally, reservation in hand (made a week in advance and with my only options being very early or very late by then), I finally made it here for dinner on a Saturday night. We had:Lamb meatballs: two whole meatballs for $12. Sigh. As a not-fan of lamb, they were quite good, without the gamey flavor I personally dislike inherent to lamb. But were they $6 apiece good? Eh...Lamb riblets: also very good, once again without the gamey flavor. Probably 3-4 riblets each, so at least a better value.Octopus: amazing. Once again, usually not the biggest fan of octopus because I find it tough and chewy, but these were tender and juicy, and the portion was generous.Calamari: great value, nothing special.Molten chocolate cake with sour cherry ice cream: a great finish to the meal. A molten chocolate cake is, well, a molten chocolate cake, but the sour cherry ice cream definitely packed a little bit of a delicious zing! Also decently sized for sharing.Price came out to about $90, most of which was the wine, so not too terrible. It's not exactly the best value for your money, but as far as most restaurants on university ave go, it's not as overpriced as it can be. And you're guaranteed to get good food in a beautiful setting. For a nice celebratory dinner out, you can't go wrong with this place.",
	"Definitely disappointed for my second time here. It had been a while since I was here. Figured we'd go back since the first time I went, I was impressed. This time, not so much.The service is great here, and the food is good. But definitely not that great to wait for. If you have reservations, I might have just had a bad night. Everything was decent, but nothing outstanding. Kokkaris in SF is still better.We ordered: - Fried smelt - Decent but not hot when served - Tzatziki - Thicker than expected - Grilled octopus - Good and would always order this - Lamb chops - A bit over done and dry - Greek sea bass (deboned) - Dry but meatyWorth a shot if you can get reservations easily.",
	"I'm a Greek and grew up eating Greek food in Manhattan and Astoria.  I went to Evvia a few nights ago and was disappointed.The restaurant was way too crowded with tables on top of each other.  Another table shouldn't have to get up to allow you to sit down.The food was also not up to decent standards:1) lamb meatballs: decent taste, but overpriced for two small meatballs2) octopus: texture was extremely mushy and the taste wasn't great either 3) smelts: didn't come out hot or even that warm. I have no idea why this place does so much business.",
	"I previously rated Evvia at 5 stars for its food and service, having been a regular visitor. However on my most recent visit a few weeks ago, with family over from Europe, my brother in law got food poisoning. He was taking a 20 hour door to door trans-Atlantic trip the next morning. Not seeking a refund but wanting to let the restaurant know, we called them. Their attitude was nothing short of appalling, suggesting that firstly food poisoning takes 12 hours to take effect (!) and that it couldn't possibly be their food. It will be a long time before we darken your door again or recommend you to business partners or friends. That is not how 5 star customer service should be, Evvia.",
	"I've been this place twice.  The first time was okay, the food wasn't anything great, but it wasn't bad--probably about three stars due to the combination of price and bad service. I disliked that their so-called \"Greek\" salad had lettuce in it--what happened to horiatiki!!!The second time was awful.  It was a Saturday night and we hadn't made reservations, so we weren't sure if we were going to be able to get in--greek food was a bit of a whim.  We talked to the hostess and she told us it would be a little over an hour, but she'd be able to seat us around 8.30pm.  We say okay, put our names down, give her our cell numbers and take a wander down the avenue.  45 minutes and one circuit around Z Gallerie and Restoration Hardware later, we return to Evvia and check in with the hostess.  She asks us to sit at the bar, it'll be a little while.  We have a round of cocktails.  We have another.  We order a order a bottle of wine and an appetizer.   TWO AND A HALF HOURS after we first walked in the door we have still not been seated.  Ravenous, we try to flag down and pay our bill.  Not able to get the bartender's attention, we throw down some money and go for dinner at Bella Luna.For god's sake hostess, if you're full up, just say so! We'd have come back some other time with reservations.   Now I'm never going back there and I'm telling of my friends to avoid the place.",
	"This is my first review, but I was so upset over the whole experience I thought that I would share it. DO NOT PLAN AN EVENT HERE! I do a lot of event planning for my job. I called up Evvia to book an event for a large party and the event planner was nothing short of RUDE!!!She, Ms. Smith, would not answer my questions, responded with questions back and an attitude. She basically told me to go look at the web page (which is of poor quality) and hung up on me!",
	"I really cannot comment on the food. I am sure it is good as other people here have said. You see, me and my family never had a chance to get to the table.It was my mom's birthday and we booked a table for 5 a few days in advance. We called in a couple of hours before to confirm and were asked to come in on time. We did and were asked to wait 20 mins by a pretty rude maitre de. Now, 20 mins for a popular highly rated and chi chi palo alto restaurant would otherwise be fine. But the 20 mins soon passed and we were asked to wait another 45 mins by the rude maitre de. So, what exactly is the point of the reservation, again? The reason given was - Oh we had a rush of people, thanks to the Cal Stanford game. Reminded me of the Seinfeld episode where Jerry tells a car reservation agent after being told that he does not have a car inspite of a reservation - \"You see, taking the reservation is not the difficult part, HOLDING it is. Anyone can take a reservation\" Now, not that the seating/waiting area is that spacious to begin with and my relatively old parents were not exactly very comfortable. No attempt was made to accomodate them given the incompetence of the front staff. We just decided to walk to another restaurant and follow it up with this review. We did not let them ruin my mom's birthday.",
	"I was going to take everyone's advise and go here with a group for my birthday until I checked the website. If you want to have a group of 12 or more you'll need to make a deposit of 50% and have a fixed price menu that starts at $55/person!This place may be great for a casual dinner but for a typical birthday bash where everyone is contributing it won't work at all. :((((They' ve lost my business.",
	"We've been to Evvia a few times before, including for my birthday and for a colleague's grant approval celebration, but they just lost us at customers. We were there at 5:15 to check for a table. The door was open, and the staff had their pre-dinner meeting in the back. After the woman by the entrance who appears to take reservations and assign tables got off the phone, she was unfriendly and said that they open at 5:30. We understood that there were \"plenty of tables\" and we didn't need a reservation for early dinner. Since I'm currently on crutches my wife asked if we could sit at a table to rest my leg and wait until they opened but when I saw her negative non-verbals I didn't even want to wait for for her to figure that out and we decided that we would walk around and come back. When I arrived back at 5:32 she said we could be seated at the bar. When I indicated that I needed a little more space and comfort because of my injury and asked her about the \"plenty of tables\" she said that \"reservations change quickly\" and they had lots of reservations now. I turned around and left. My wife had parked the car closer and went back in to discuss the event with the manager. He was polite and offered a table immediately, but I am not willing to be lied to and treated like that by their first contact person and still enjoy a reasonably expensive dinner.",
	"I am a big fan of Meditteranean food and would love to find a place that blows my mind, but this place disappointed. I ordered grilled fish, but it was soaked in olive oil and bland. I just remember everything being bland and oily. Nothing great stuck in my mind about this place.",
	"First course, salad. Had a match stick, that was previously lit, in the salad.  Noticed it when I was chewing and pulled it out of my mouth.... EEEEWWWW!!!Brought it to the attention of the waiter.  Apologized, didn't seemed shocked and that was it.  Didn't bring me a new salad.Still charged me for the salad..... Didn't get a free dessert....I couldn't even get past the the match stick to like the food.If I could give it less than one star...I would!!",
	"It is sort of a creepy place because the owner brings his girlfriend here and he is married. Just a bad vibe. The lamb was fatty and its a little expensive on wine.  I prefer the next shop on the corner of University Avenue than to watch a bunch of  married guys in their 70;s hit on young girls.",
	"I actually always love the food at Evvia -it's the snooty service and treatment that I'm really getting tired of.  As a single woman, who from time to time dines alone, every time I walk into Evvia it's like a Jekyll or Hide experience - will they be nice and treat me as a valued customer, or will they pass judgment and decide they would rather have a COUPLE dining with them and the hope of a larger tip at the end of the meal?  This happened to me tonight.  After seeing a movie at the Aquarius, I walked over to see if I could get dinner at the bar.  It was packed (no surprise).  the host graciously escorted me to the bar to size up the length of the wait (very good so far).  Then the bartender (not John - he's always nice) proceeded to explain in a not so nice manner why the diners at the bar (all couples- who when dining there have a tendency not to talk to singles dining beside them - another  trait of ignorance) were just starting or taking their time and therefore I could expect  AT LEAST a 30 minute wait, and perhaps I MIGHT like  glass of wine (which I had actually mentioned to him already) or maybe not.  I've had this experience at Evvia often enough that I would say the owners need to train the staff better. Maybe the restaurant is doing so well they can afford to treat potential customers shabbily?  Btw -I am a great tipper, I wish bartenders would get over this. Anyway, I walked down the street to Lavanda and had a meal that, while not the caliber of Evvia, was perfectly fine, accompanied by excellent, kind, friendly service.",
	"After having the Greek salad I was served the lamb chops.  I had asked that they be served medium.  Well , they came medium rare.  I returned them and they brought them back well done and dry.I asked the waiter what had happened and he told me that they had to put them back on the grill and they got well done.After hearing that, I decided not to argue with the waiter, but felt that the lamb chops could have been cooked more to order.",
	"After reading the reviews, I was fantastically excited to dine here. Shame on me for not booking in advance... I would love to come back and try the food, but walked away feeling insulted: how dare I have the temerity to arrive at Evvia without a reservation?!We walk in the door, but upon being acknowledged by the hostess as walk-ins, proceed to sit and wait for literally 10 minutes until we are given any answer to availability. The answer, \"we will try to squeeze you in.\"Okay , I can do that. It looks and smells amazing.50 minutes go by, 6.55pm to 7.45pm. 55 minutes. No room at the bar --- a minuscule affair  --- leaving us sitting at two of four tiny seats literally in the doorway.Admist the wait, another host shows up and gestures to us. Oh, those are \"walk ins,\" they sigh rolling their eyes. The three of us avert our eyes in shame.Other than this condescending remark? One update. Fifty minutes. Sitting literrally next to not one, but two hosts.Unacceptable.",
	"I recieved a call from the owner today to discuss my experience and go over the events that evening. I was told he was going to investigate and get back with me. This is a positive move on his part and congratulate for reaching out. I told him about my past experience with his SF restaurant and would always have find memories of good food and good service. This establihsment in Palo Alto however needs some adjustsments and fine tuning. I will update when I have my 2nd call with him.Update; No call back as promised,I'm done with this process; another lip service....my ratings stand.",
	"Arrived to find to my reservations was changed without notice or apology. Last visit for me, your LACK of consideration and professionalism is not worth my money or time. Thank you Evvia for totally embarassing me and my guests!I'm happy to say that if anyone wants to enjoy fantastic service, taseful staff without lip service and errogant hostess go accross the street to BAKLAVA!",
	"Tried to go there last night (Tuesday) at about 8pm, party of two women, professionally dressed, with no reservation.Not sure what was wrong, with the mature gentleman host working the front door but the level of attitude he directed at us the moment we crossed the threshold turned me off from this place indefinitely.I have been regular and consistent customers of Kokkari in San Francisco, and am saddened by the attitude I received at my first and now last visit to Evvia.",
	"I had a bad experience at this restaurant when I decided to take the family there for my wife's birthday. The place was crowded with little elbow room. We ordered lamb chop well done and it was served bloody. It took them 2 more tries to get rid of the blood but it ended almost to a crisp. We talked to the waitress and the manager and surprisingly they would not admit being at fault, and insinuated we were difficult, and attempted to charge us for that order that we did not even eat. 3 out of the 4 dishes were good. I still cannot understand all the hype about the place. I've had excellent lamb in other mediterranean or arab restaurants in the Bay area. Overall we were disappointed by the service, and the price. I would not spend a penny there again.",
	"I haven't even set foot in this restaurant yet but so far i have to give it 0-1 stars.  I have a friend that raves about the food and I'm sure it is very good, so my review is just from what I experienced in making a reservation.I called to make our reservation which is not for a mont and a half away.  I have heard it is hard to get in at a decent dinner time.  However, the hostess that answered my call was rude and hung up on me in the middle of my sentence.  I called her back to let her know that I know what a nice restaurant it is and that I expected never to be hung up before I got done talking.  She said she thought I was already finished talking.  When I asked to speak to her manager she told me that I had already finished speaking when she hung up.  I believe I would be the one to know if I was done talking or not.  Either way she just hung up the phone without saying thank you or good bye.Anyhow, tha is my 2 cents and I'm hoping when we have dinner there that the service will not be like I how I was treated over the phone.",
	"Had heard this place was good and booked a reservation Monday night. The lady server was not the nicest. I asked for recommendations and were given short \"anything was good\" comment which was not helpful as no one  else at the table have eaten there before. I ordered the fish and when I recieved my plate and bit into the fish- after eating a few bite fuls, we realized the fish was not cooked! pink on the inside. We told the server and she wasn't very apologetic and just asked if we wanted to have it reheated. No way! Bad experience, terrible plate & now risk the chance of parasitic worms in my stomach. Not what I was expecting from a restaurant with such great reviews.",
	"This is a solid place that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. It's great for grad students - the food is reasonably good, really well-priced, and given out in huge portions. Definitely good for a last-minute dinner or lunch.",
	"I like to get the Chicken Caesar Salad or the Thai Red Curry Chicken bowl here. Lots of variety in terms of cuisine, averaging around $6-8 per entree. Convenient for grad students living on campus.",
	"Why??? Why do they let this place exist?? It's the only place open to grab dinner quickly near Escondido so grad students are left with no choice. Also it's got the customer base from GCC. I guess it's an ok place to grab a beer but man is the food and service horrible. Not one thing here tastes good or is cooked properly, the rice is always stale, the meats often stink, the burgers always miss components, etc etc. The list of screwups is endless. Be it dine in or take out, the food and service are despicable. I really feel that they should lease that space out to someone else who will actually serve good food and give some form of service. Maybe I'm asking too much from a place on campus but then the others open in the day are all so fantastic.",
	"I wish Ray's had been around when I was a grad student. Lots of choices, open early-late, not too expensive. A good place to go for breakfast after hiking the Dish. If a Stanford game is on they've got it on. Don't expect fancy and you'll be happy.",
	"I liked it better back when it was the 750. I occasionally frequent it for the fish and chips, but I get the sense the quality has gone down since three or four years ago.It's a shame, because it gets so much good business from grad students.",
	"She's a grad student, so I figured we should just meet for drinks here. I hadn't been back at the 750 (now called Ray's) since 2006. I figured, how bad could it be? It'll be dark, and I can have some whiskey. Win-win.Shit. I was wrong.Basically, the 750 closed down and re-opened with a new name plus an identity crisis. When I walked in, I was confused as to what kind of place this was. Is it a bar, a cafe, or a study area? Yes, the old 750 was a mediocre bar, but at least it was a bar. It knew who it was, and there's something to be said for that. On the other hand, Ray's is bright. The table setup is like a late night cafe at Stanford. It does have a bar, but it only serves beer and wine. That's right: no hard alcohol.Given the lack of spirits, the bartender sold me a bottle of wine for $10, which was a pretty good deal. They only had red wine, but that's okay, since I do it for the antioxidants. He gave us two plastic cups, which is always very classy.As terrible as this may sound, it was actually a fun evening. I got to consume more than half a bottle of wine and enjoy good company. Would I come back? No.",
	"Not really a bar and not really a lounge either.  I went here to watch the men's basketball team play in the Pac-10 tournament on their TVs.  Didn't really find a large crowd that I expected, but nonetheless, the people there were enjoying the game.  It's pretty sterile feeling, but there's good beer on tap - including Kona Longboard Lager, one of my favorites.  And it's reasonably priced as well.  So not bad.  It would make sense to come here if you're a grad student, which is the primary group it caters too, but if you're from around the area, maybe you should stick to downtown Palo Alto.",
	"This place is lame.It's not a sports bar because it only has 1 (maybe 2) TVs.  It also has a dinky jukebox, a pool table, and a handful of tables.I've only been here once and had a good time, and they (the bartenders) called the cops (campus rent-a-cop sheriffs) on one of my friends because she was drunk.  Aren't people supposed to drink at a bar?The only time I've ever been grateful that The 750 was even on campus was back in 2006 when they aired the World Cup games and would let people pile in at 5:30 a.m.I know grad students are awkward, don't socialize well (esp with non-grad students), and rarely leave campus, but there are about 37 or 38 other places that i'd rather go to to enjoy a beer within 5 miles of the 750",
	"Ray's is WAY better than the 750. If you're a grad student, this is a much-needed addition to the east side of campus. You can work there in the morning over coffee, and switch to beer at 5pm. And you can eat there and the food is good. What more can you ask from a grad student coffee house that sells beer?",
	"I like this place for watching a game.  Pretty good food, very convenient and the bartenders are friendly.  Not a rowdy sports bar.  It is what it is.  If I wasn't a grad student who lives 2 minutes away by foot, I probobly wouldn't come all that often (or ever).",
	"This is strange, but I REALLY like the wings here. The angry habanero and the sweet tequila are definitely worth trying.The portion size for the mexican and asian food is pretty generous for the price and they're open late-ish, so this is definitely a quality option for the lazy, poor graduate students living in Rains/EV (like myself). I wish it was open even later, though."
